# Introduction

Pierre de Fermat is legendary for his "Last Theorem", which took more than
*<a href="http://math.stanford.edu/~lekheng/flt/wiles.pdf" title="Wiles' Proof, which I should probably try reading someday, maybe.">350 years to solve</a>*.
However, although this theorem is incredibly famous, I find how Fermat introduced this theorem incredibly amusing as he wrote the problem on the margins of
*<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetica" title="Also on my list of books to read along with Euclid's Elements.">
Arithmetica</a>*. In this problem he stated:

<div title="It almost feels like a student wrote this on his homework...">
  <p align="center" style="font-style: italic;font-family: 'Times New Roman', Georgia, Serif;">
    Cubum autem in duos cubos, aut quadratoquadratum in duos quadratoquadratos & generaliter nullam in infinitum
    ultra quadratum potestatem in duos eiusdem nominis fas est dividere cuius rei demonstrationem mirabilem sane detexi.
    Hanc marginis exiguitas non caperet.
  </p>

  <p align="center" style="font-style: italic;font-family: 'Times New Roman', Georgia, Serif;">
    It is impossible to separate a cube into two cubes, or a fourth power into two fourth powers, or in general,
    any power higher than the second, into two like powers. I have discovered a truly marvelous proof of this,
    which this margin is too narrow to contain.
  </p>
</div>

I think most people doubt that Fermat "solved" this theorem, as he probably underestimated it and didn't solve it completely.
Some may say that
*<span title="If he halted doing it, does that mean he could've solved the halting problem?">
  Fermat did solve it and had a beautfiul answer, but it is now lost through time...</span>*

Whether you believe that Fermat solved it or not, I feel that I also have the power to use such an excuse.
And thus, I have decided to create a way for anyone to create their own "Fermat margin" using this page.
This page also creates custom formats for HTML, Markdown, and LaTeX, in case you wanted to use it for
a different occasion. However, this does beg the question?

*<span title="Wiles did it.">
Can you publish a paper with a Fermat margin?</span>*

# Custom Fermat Margin

## Form

<form>
  <div class="form-group">
    <label for="quest">Quest: </label>
    <input type="text" class="form-control input-lg" id="quest" value="It is impossible to separate a cube into two cubes, or a fourth power into two fourth powers, or in general, any power higher than the second, into two like powers">
  </div>
  <div class="form-group">
    <label for="medium">Medium: </label>
    <input type="text" class="form-control input-lg" id="medium" value="margin">
  </div>
</form>

## Output

<p align="center" style="font-style: italic;font-family: 'Times New Roman', Georgia, Serif;">
  <span class="quest-text">QUEST</span>. I have discovered a truly marvelous proof of this,
  which this <span class="medium-text">MEDIUM</span> is too narrow to contain.
